                I am very curious, and this drives me to research various topics, especially in the field of technology, 
                such as software (software architecture, software design, design patterns, messaging, etc.), or something more 
                related to hardware and low-level topics like electronics and low-level programming languages.

            <div class="hobby-desc">
                I like playing video games, especially single-player ones. Although I also enjoy multiplayer games to spend time playing and chatting with my friends.

                I really enjoy playing baseball, but I don't like watching the games. I like playing as a pitcher or an outfielder because I really enjoy pitching.

            <div class="hobby-desc">
                really enjoy music, especially the kind used in video game or movie soundtracks. I love the combination of many instruments to create an atmosphere 
                that matches what’s on screen. I plan to buy a piano in the future so I can learn the basics of music, like reading sheet music and everything, 
                in order to make my own tracks or songs of that type of music.

            <div class="hobby-desc">
                I like everything related to science and space, but also biology, such as how living beings relate to their environment, 
                how they evolved, why they evolved, why species go extinct, etc.
